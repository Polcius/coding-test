# Coding Test

## Live version

[Deployed on Netlify](https://cocky-payne-dfc1d9.netlify.com/)

## Notes

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the TypeScript template.

I am using `create-react-app` because it already includes a Webpack configuration and is already setup for TypeScript usage and for writing tests.

In order to see the configuration, you can run `yarn eject` or `npm run eject`, which will expose all the settings to be checked or modified. Please bear in mind that once you run the `eject` command, there is no going back.

## Usage

You will have to run `yarn install`. To run the development version, run `yarn start`. To run the tests, run `yarn test`. You can also build a production-ready app by running `yarn build`. If you use NPM, replace `yarn` with `npm run`.
