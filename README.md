# Coding Test

## Notes

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the TypeScript template.

I am using the `create-react-app` boilerplate because it already includes a Webpack configuration and is already setup for writing tests. In order to see the configuration, you can run `yarn eject` or `npm run eject`, which will expose all the settings.

## Packages added
